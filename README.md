## Description 

KnoPressure is a blood pressure app built using React.js.  This App will allow you to enter your daily blood pressure information and it tracks the results and   will display how your blood pressure is trending in the chart.  With this physical view you can see when your blood pressure is Normal, High or Low and can take corresponding action.  We also provide some Health tips and links. !!!! But our disclaimer:  See your doctor first if you have a health problem  !!!
